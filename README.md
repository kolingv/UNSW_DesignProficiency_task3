-This is a reference to Elec9123 UNSW course on Task3

- A log recording my work progress might be helpful. 

-Task is about controling(PID) a simulated motro with a 2nd-order type 1 circuit based on Arduino. Tanks for opening source, coding is not hard but did for motor modeling and hardward debugging.
